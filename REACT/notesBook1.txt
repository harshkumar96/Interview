=> What is SPA(Single Page Application)
    A Single Page Application (SPA) is a type of web application that loads only one HTML page once, and after that, updates the content dynamically using 
    JavaScript — WITHOUT reloading the entire page.
    In simple words:
    -> Only one page is loaded initially
    -> When you navigate, content changes instantly
    -> No full page reload (no white flash)
    -> Faster and smoother experience — just like a mobile app

=> How SPA Works

=> React is probably one of the best choices for building single page applications nowadays. It only delivers the view layer, but the React ecosystem is a whole 
flexible and interchangeable framework. React has a slim API, an amazing ecosystem and a great community.
