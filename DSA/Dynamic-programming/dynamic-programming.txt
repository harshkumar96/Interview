Dynamic programming is defined as a computer programming technique where an algorithmic problem is first broken down into sub-problems, 
the results are saved, and then the sub-problems are optimized to find the overall solution — which usually has to do with finding 
the maximum and minimum range of the algorithmic query.

Dynamic programming is used when one can break a problem into more minor issues that they can break down even further, into even more minor problems. 
Additionally, these subproblems have overlapped. That is, they require previously calculated values to be recomputed. With dynamic programming, 
the computed values are stored, thus reducing the need for repeated calculations and saving time and providing faster solutions. 

To design an algorithm for a problem using Dynamic Programming, the problem we want to solve must have these two properties:

=> Overlapping Subproblems: Means that the problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, where the solutions to the subproblems are overlapping. 
Having subproblems that are overlapping means that the solution to one subproblem is part of the solution to another subproblem.
=> Optimal Substructure: Means that the complete solution to a problem can be constructed from the solutions of its smaller subproblems. 
So not only must the problem have overlapping subproblems, the substructure must also be optimal so that there is a way to piece the solutions to 
the subproblems together to form the complete solution.
