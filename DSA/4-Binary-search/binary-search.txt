=> Explain Binary Search
    Binary Search is a searching algorithm that operates on a sorted or monotonic search space, repeatedly dividing it into halves to find a target value or 
    optimal answer in logarithmic time O(log N).

=> Conditions to apply Binary Search Algorithm in a Data Structure
    To apply Binary Search algorithm:
    -> The data structure must be sorted.
    -> Access to any element of the data structure should take constant time.

=> Below is the step-by-step algorithm for Binary Search:
    -> Divide the search space into two halves by finding the middle index "mid". 
    -> Compare the middle element of the search space with the key. 
    -> If the key is found at middle element, the process is terminated.
    -> If the key is not found at middle element, choose which half will be used as the next search space.
        -> If the key is smaller than the middle element, then the left side is used for next search.
        -> If the key is larger than the middle element, then the right side is used for next search.
    -> This process is continued until the key is found or the total search space is exhausted.

=> Time Complexity: 
    -> Best Case: O(1)
    -> Average Case: O(log N)
    -> Worst Case: O(log N)
=> Auxiliary Space: O(1), If the recursive call stack is considered then the auxiliary space will be O(log N).
