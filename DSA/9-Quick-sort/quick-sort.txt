=> What is Quick Sort Algorithm
    Quick sort is one of the sorting algorithms that works on the idea of divide and conquer. It takes an element as a pivot and partitions the given array 
    around that pivot by placing it in the correct position in the sorted array. The pivot element can be selected in the following ways:
    -> Select the First element as a pivot
    -> Select the Last element as a pivot
    -> Select the Middle element as a pivot
    -> Select a Random element as a pivot

=> Working of Quick Sort Algorithm
    QuickSort works on divide and conquer. It takes one element as a pivot and moves it to the correct position in a way that all elements at left are smaller 
    and all elements at right are greater than the pivot and hence partitions the array at the pivot and again applies the same for the created partition subarray

=> Programmatic Approach for Quick Sort
    -> First, create a recursive function that takes array, low value and high value as input and calls the partition fucntion for recursive call for partitioned arrays.
    -> Define a partition function for last element as pivot and give the partition index of array.
    -> Partition function iterate the given array and compare elements to pivot. If smallar then swap them to a sequential postion else no swap is performed.
    -> At the end for iteration the pivot element is swapped to its correct position stored in i for the exact place.
    -> Now return the latest position of the pivot element

=> Quick sort is simple and easily implementable sorting technique that works on the divide and conquer approach. It is efficient for working on large dataset.

=> Time complexity of quickk sort is O(N log(N)) and auxiilary space required is O(N).
