=> Explain Merge Sort
    Merge sort is a popular sorting algorithm known for its efficiency and stability. It follows the Divide and Conquer approach. It works by recursively dividing 
    the input array into two halves, recursively sorting the two halves and finally merging them back together to obtain the sorted array.
    Here's a step-by-step explanation of how merge sort works:
    -> Divide: Divide the list or array recursively into two halves until it can no more be divided.
    -> Conquer: Each subarray is sorted individually using the merge sort algorithm.
    -> Merge: The sorted subarrays are merged back together in sorted order. The process continues until all elements from both subarrays have been merged.

=> Complexity Analysis of Merge Sort
    Time Complexity:
    -> Best Case: O(n log n), When the array is already sorted or nearly sorted.
    -> Average Case: O(n log n), When the array is randomly ordered.
    -> Worst Case: O(n log n), When the array is sorted in reverse order.
    Auxiliary Space: O(n), Additional space is required for the temporary array used during merging.

=> Advantages and Disadvantages of Merge Sort
    Advantages
    -> Stability : Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm, which means it maintains the relative order of equal elements in the input array.
    -> Guaranteed worst-case performance: Merge sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(N logN) , which means it performs well even on large datasets.
    -> Simple to implement: The divide-and-conquer approach is straightforward.
    -> Naturally Parallel : We independently merge subarrays that makes it suitable for parallel processing.
    Disadvantages
    -> Space complexity: Merge sort requires additional memory to store the merged sub-arrays during the sorting process.
    -> Not in-place: Merge sort is not an in-place sorting algorithm, which means it requires additional memory to store the sorted data. This can be a 
    disadvantage in applications where memory usage is a concern.
    -> Merge Sort is Slower than QuickSort in general as QuickSort is more cache friendly because it works in-place.
