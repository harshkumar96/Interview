Tree Traversal techniques include various ways to visit all the nodes of the tree. Unlike linear data structures
(Array, Linked List, Queues, Stacks, etc) which have only one logical way to traverse them, trees can be traversed in different ways.
In this article, we will discuss all the tree traversal techniques along with their uses.

There are multiple tree traversal techniques that decide the order in which the nodes of the tree are to be visited.
These are defined below:
=> Depth First Search or DFS
    Inorder Traversal
    Preorder Traversal
    Postorder Traversal
=> Level Order Traversal or Breadth First Search or BFS

Inorder traversal visits the node in the order: Left -> Root -> Right
Preorder traversal visits the node in the order: Root -> Left -> Right
Postorder traversal visits the node in the order: Left -> Right -> Root
Level Order Traversal visits all nodes present in the same level completely before visiting the next level.
