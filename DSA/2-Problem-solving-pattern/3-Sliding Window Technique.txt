=> Sliding Window Technique is a method used to solve problems that involve subarray or substring or window.
    -> Instead of repeatedly iterating over the same elements, the sliding window maintains a range (or “window”) that moves step-by-step through the data, 
    updating results incrementally.
    -> The main idea is to use the results of previous window to do computations for the next window.
    -> Commonly used for problems like finding subarrays with a specific sum, finding the longest substring with unique characters, or solving problems 
    that require a fixed-size window to process elements efficiently.

=> Using the Sliding Window Technique - O(n) Time and O(1) Space
    -> We compute the sum of the first k elements out of n terms using a linear loop and store the sum in variable window_sum.
    -> Then we will traverse linearly over the array till it reaches the end and simultaneously keep track of the maximum sum.
    -> To get the current sum of a block of k elements just subtract the first element from the previous block and add the last element of the current block.
