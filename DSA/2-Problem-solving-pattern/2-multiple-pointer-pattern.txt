=> Also known as Two Pointers Technique

=> The Two-Pointers Technique is a simple yet powerful strategy where you use two indices (pointers) that traverse a data structure—such as an array, list, 
    or string—either toward each other or in the same direction to solve problems more efficiently

=> When to Use Two Pointers:
    -> Sorted Input : If the array or list is already sorted (or can be sorted), two pointers can efficiently find pairs or ranges. Example: Find two numbers in a 
        sorted array that add up to a target.
    -> Pairs or Subarrays : When the problem asks about two elements, subarrays, or ranges instead of working with single elements. Example: Longest substring 
        without repeating characters, maximum consecutive ones, checking if a string is palindrome.
    -> Sliding Window Problems : When you need to maintain a window of elements that grows/shrinks based on conditions. Example: Find smallest subarray 
        with sum ≥ K, move all zeros to end while maintaining order.
    -> Linked Lists (Slow–Fast pointers) : Detecting cycles, finding the middle node, or checking palindrome property. Example: Floyd’s Cycle Detection 
        Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare).
