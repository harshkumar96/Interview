=> Divide and Conquer Algorithm is a problem-solving technique used to solve problems by dividing the main problem into subproblems, solving them 
individually and then merging them to find solution to the original problem. Divide and Conquer is mainly useful when we divide a problem into independent 
subproblems. If we have overlapping subproblems, then we use Dynamic Programming.
