=> Frequency Counter pattern
    The Frequency Counter pattern uses an object or set to collect values and the frequency of those values. This pattern is often used with an array or a string, 
    and allows you to avoid nested loops (quadratic time complexity O(n²)).

=> When should Frequency Counter pattern pattern be used?
    Frequency counters are most frequently(pun intended) used to compare data in some way. Some common problems I have seen on Leetcode where a frequency 
    counter could be used are ones that compare different arrays or strings, such as checking whether two strings are anagrams of each other.
