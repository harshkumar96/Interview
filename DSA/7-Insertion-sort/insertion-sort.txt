=> Explain Insertion Sort
    Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion 
    of the list. 
    -> We start with the second element of the array as the first element is assumed to be sorted.
    -> Compare the second element with the first element if the second element is smaller then swap them.
    -> Move to the third element, compare it with the first two elements, and put it in its correct position
    -> Repeat until the entire array is sorted.

=> Complexity Analysis of Insertion Sort
    Time Complexity
    -> Best case: O(n), If the list is already sorted, where n is the number of elements in the list.
    -> Average case: O(n2), If the list is randomly ordered
    -> Worst case: O(n2), If the list is in reverse order
    Space Complexity
    -> Auxiliary Space: O(1), Insertion sort requires O(1) additional space, making it a space-efficient sorting algorithm.

=> Advantages and Disadvantages of Insertion Sort
    Advantages:
    -> Simple and easy to implement.
    -> Stable sorting algorithm.
    -> Efficient for small lists and nearly sorted lists.
    -> Space-efficient as it is an in-place algorithm.
    -> Adoptive. the number of inversions is directly proportional to number of swaps. For example, no swapping happens for a sorted array and it takes O(n) time only.

    Disadvantages
    -> Inefficient for large lists.
    -> Not as efficient as other sorting algorithms (e.g., merge sort, quick sort) for most cases.
