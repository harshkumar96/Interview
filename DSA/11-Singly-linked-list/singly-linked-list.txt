=> Explain Singly Linked List
    A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes. Each node contains:
    -> A value (the data it holds).
    -> A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.
    This structure forms a chain of nodes, starting from a head (the first node) and ending at a node whose next reference is null. Linked lists are dynamic, 
    meaning they can grow or shrink as needed, unlike arrays with fixed sizes.

=> Advantages of a Linked List
    -> Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow or shrink as needed during program execution, unlike arrays with fixed sizes.
    -> Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Adding or removing elements in the middle of a linked list is generally faster than in an array (especially if you already 
    have a reference to the node before the insertion/deletion point), as you only need to change pointers.
    -> No Memory Waste (Potentially): Linked lists only use as much memory as they need, as nodes are allocated individually. Arrays, on the other hand, might 
    have unused space if they're allocated with a larger size than required.
    -> Flexible Data Structure: Linked lists are used to implement various other data structures, like stacks, queues, and graphs.
    -> Memory Allocation Flexibility: Nodes can be stored in non-contiguous memory locations, reducing the need for large, contiguous blocks of memory.
