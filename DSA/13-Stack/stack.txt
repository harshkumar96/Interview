=> Explain Stacks
    A stack is a linear data structure that allows operations to be performed at one end, called the top. The two primary operations are:
    -> Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
    -> Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack
    It fundamental data structure in computer science that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack 
    will be the first one to be removed. Stacks are widely used in various applications, such as function call management, undo mechanisms, and parsing expressions.
