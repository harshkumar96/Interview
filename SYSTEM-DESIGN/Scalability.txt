=> Vertical scaling means larger Machine that can Process request faster
    1) Load Balancer not required
    2) Single point of failure
    3) Inter Process Communication
    4) Data Consistency (e.g. Transactions)
    5) Hardware Limitations

=> Horizontal scaling more machines to handle request
    1) Load Balancer required
    2) Resilient
    3) Network call betwwen servers (RPC)
    4) Data Inconsistency (e.g. Transactions)
    5) Scale Well as users increase
