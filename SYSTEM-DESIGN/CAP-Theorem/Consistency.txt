=> Explain Consistency
    All clients see the same data at the same time. After a write happens, every read should return the most recent write — no stale or conflicting data.
    In CAP, consistency is:
    Linearizability 
    Every read reflects the latest successful write as if all operations happened in a single global order.
    📌 This is stronger than just “data correctness”.

=> Types of Consistency (Very Important)
    Consistency defines how up-to-date and ordered data appears across distributed systems. Strong consistency guarantees latest data at the cost of 
    availability, while eventual consistency maximizes availability by allowing temporary inconsistencies. Between these extremes lie practical models like 
    causal, session, and monotonic consistency, which balance correctness and performance based on application needs.

    1️⃣ Strong Consistency (Linearizability)
    After a successful write, all subsequent reads anywhere in the system return the latest value. The system behaves as if there is one single copy of data 
    and one global timeline.
        Guarantee:
        -> Reads always return latest write
        -> Global order of operations
        How achieved:
        -> Single leader
        -> Synchronous replication
        -> Majority quorum
        Cost:
        -> High latency
        -> Lower availability
        Used in:
        -> Banking
        -> Inventory
        -> Payments
    2️⃣ Eventual Consistency
    If no new updates are made, all replicas will eventually converge. Eventual consistency prioritizes availability and scalability, allowing temporary 
    inconsistencies that resolve over time.
        Guarantee:
        -> If no new writes, all replicas converge eventually
        Reality:
        -> Temporary stale reads allowed
        Benefits:
        -> High availability
        -> Low latency
        -> Partition tolerant
        Used in:
        -> Social feeds
        -> Likes
        -> Analytics
    3️⃣ Causal Consistency
    Causally related operations are seen in the same order, but unrelated operations may be seen in different orders.
    Guarantee:
    -> Related operations maintain order
    -> Unrelated operations may be seen out of order

=> Consistency vs Availability (CAP Trade-off)
    | Choice | What Happens                               |
    | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
    | CP     | System blocks or errors to stay consistent |
    | AP     | System serves stale data but stays up      |

=> Consistency in Distributed Databases
    1) MongoDB
        Default: Strong consistency for primary reads
        Replicas → eventual consistency
        Read Concern controls consistency
    2) Cassandra
        Tunable consistency:
        -> ONE
        -> QUORUM
        -> ALL
    3) Redis
        Strong on single node
        Eventual with replicas

=> Consistency Mechanisms (How Systems Achieve It)
    1) Leader-Based Replication
    Leader-based replication ensures strong consistency for writes by serializing them through a single primary node.
    -> One leader accepts writes
    -> Followers replicate
    ✔️ Strong consistency for leader reads
    📌 Core Idea
    -> One leader (primary) accepts all writes
    -> Followers (replicas) copy data from leader
    -> Reads may go to leader or replicas
    2) Quorum Reads & Writes
    3) Distributed Consensus
    4) Locks & Transactions
    5) Synchronous Replication
    6) Asynchronous Replication
    7) Versioning & Vector Clocks
    

=> What Breaks Consistency (Failure Modes)
    | Issue               | Effect           |
    | ------------------- | ---------------- |
    | Network partition   | Split brain      |
    | Async replication   | Stale reads      |
    | Clock skew          | Wrong ordering   |
    | Cache               | Serving old data |
    | Multi-leader writes | Conflicts        |
