SQL UNION clause/operator is used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements without returning any duplicate rows.

To use UNION, each SELECT must have the same number of columns selected, the same number of column expressions, 
the same data type, and have them in the same order, but they do not have to be the same length.

=> The UNION ALL operator is used to combine the results of two SELECT statements including duplicate rows.
=> SQL INTERSECT Clause: is used to combine two SELECT statements, but returns rows only from the first
SELECT statement that are identical to a row in the second SELECT statement.
=> SQL EXCEPT Clause : combines two SELECT statements and returns rows from the first SELECT statement
that are not returned by the second SELECT statement.

The SQL INTERSECT clause/operator is used to combine two SELECT statements, but returns rows only from the
first SELECT statement that are identical to a row in the second SELECT statement. This means INTERSECT
returns only common rows returned by the two SELECT statements.

The SQL EXCEPT clause/operator is used to combine two SELECT statements and returns rows from the first
SELECT statement that are not returned by the second SELECT statement. This means EXCEPT returns only
rows, which are not available in second SELECT statement.
