Subquery or Inner query or Nested query is a query within another SQL query and embedded within the WHERE clause.
A subquery is used to return data that will be used in the main query as a condition to further restrict the data to
be retrieved.
Subqueries can be used with the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements along with the operators 
like =, <, >, >=, <=, IN, BETWEEN etc.

There are a few rules that subqueries must follow:
=> Subqueries must be enclosed within parentheses.
=> A subquery can have only one column in the SELECT clause, unless multiple columns are in the main query for the 
subquery to compare its selected columns.
=> An ORDER BY cannot be used in a subquery, although the main query can use an ORDER BY. The GROUP BY can be used 
to perform the same function as the ORDER BY in a subquery.
=> Subqueries that return more than one row can only be used with multiple value operators, such as the IN operator.
=> The SELECT list cannot include any references to values that evaluate to a BLOB, ARRAY, CLOB, or NCLOB.
=> A subquery cannot be immediately enclosed in a set function.
=> The BETWEEN operator cannot be used with a subquery; however, the BETWEEN operator can be used within the subquery.
