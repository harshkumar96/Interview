=> Define Interface
    An interface is a contract that defines the shape of an object.
    👉 It tells TypeScript:
    -> what properties an object must have
    -> what methods it must implement
    -> what are types of those properties/methods
    It is compile-time only (removed in JS output).

=> Properties of interface
    1) Optional Properties (?)
    2) Readonly Properties: Used when value must not change after creation.
    3) Function Type Interface
    4) Interface for Classes (VERY IMPORTANT):
        👉 Enforces design consistency
        👉 Very useful in clean architecture / LLD
